# Runite Rocks [![Plugin Installs](http://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://i.pluginhub.info/shields/installs/plugin/runite-rocks)](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/TheStonedTurtle) [![Plugin Rank](http://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://i.pluginhub.info/shields/rank/plugin/runite-rocks)](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub)
Adds a new side panel for tracking Runite ore respawns. Works for all 25 Runite rock spawns in game.

## How it works

1) [Runite Rocks](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Runite_rock) respawn 12 minutes after they are mined.
2) The Plugin only tracks rocks that have been seen during the current client session
3) If you do not see the ore being depleted the timer will be marked orange to indicate it is inaccurate.
	* This means the real respawn time is between the last visit and respawn times.
